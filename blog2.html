        <h2>HTTP response status codes</h2>
        <p>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.
           Responses are grouped in five classes:</p>
           <p>1. Informational responses (100 – 199)</p>
           <p>2. Successful responses (200 – 299)</p>
           <p>3. Redirection messages (300 – 399)</p>
           <p>4. Client error responses (400 – 499)</p>
           <p>5. Server error responses (500 – 599)</p>

           <h3>Informational responses</h3>
           <dl>
            <dt>100 continue</dt>
            <p>This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response 
                if the request is already finished.</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>101 Switching Protocols</dt>
            <p>This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client and
                indicates the protocol the server is switching to.</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>103 Early Hints</dt>
            <p>This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading 
                resources while the server prepares a response.</p>
           </dl>
           <!-- Successful responses- -->
           <h3>Successful responses</h3>
           <dl>
            <dt>200 OK</dt>
            <p>The request succeeded. The result meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method: Get, Head, Put, Post , Trace</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>201 Created</dt>
            <p>The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>202 Accepted</dt>
            <p>The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>203 Non-Authoritative Information</dt>
            <p>This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, 
                but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource.
                 Except for that specific case, the 200 OK response is preferred to this status.</p>
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>204 No Content</dt>
            <p>There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.</p>
            
           </dl>

           <dl>
            <dt>205 Reset Content</dt>
            <p>Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.</p>
           </dl>

           
           <dl>
            <dt>206 Partial Content</dt>
            <p>This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource.</p>
